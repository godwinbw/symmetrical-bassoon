### This challenge is to update an existing budget tracker to allow for offline access and functionality

### **User Story**

    AS AN avid traveler
    I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
    SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 

### **Acceptance Critera**

1.  User can input an expense or deposit while they have no internet connection

    WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
    THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit

2.  User changes made while offline are added when users regain internet connection

    WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
    THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
